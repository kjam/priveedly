                <description><![CDATA[ <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In June, Argentina's executive branch filed a new bill to replace the current Personal Data Protection Law with the National Congress of Argentina.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The new bill, the <a href="https://www.argentina.gob.ar/noticias/el-poder-ejecutivo-nacional-envio-al-congreso-el-proyecto-de-ley-de-proteccion-de-datos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Draft Law on the Protection of Personal Data</a>, is based on the preliminary bill drafted by Argentina's data protection authority, the Agency for Access to Public Information, in Sept. 2022 and comments to the preliminary draft filed by members of the public and private sectors during a public consultation process.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If the proposed legislation is passed, the current personal data protection regime will be updated to reflect the following principles.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Under the proposed legislation, the definition of sensitive data would be updated to include any information referring to the private sphere of individuals, including gender identity, genetic information and biometric data, and use that might result in discrimination or entail a high risk to data subjects. It would also clarify the scope of the provisions of the law to indicate they cannot affect the duty of secrecy regarding a journalist's sources. However, they apply to any other processing of personal data carried out in the context of a journalist's activities.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Extraterritorial application of the law is included in the proposed bill and applies to those located in Argentina, even when the processing is performed in another country. It also applies to those not located in Argentina but who comply with other conditions, such as providing goods and services to those within the country.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Processing of personal data</span></strong></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The proposed legislation includes the accountability principle, which makes controllers and processors responsible for conducting due diligence measures to identify, prevent, be accountable for and mitigate the impacts of its processing activities.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Additionally, a new legal basis apart from consent will be recognized in the proposed draft, including the data controller's legitimate interest or execution of preliminary contractual measures. Data controllers must carry out a detailed, prior and documented analysis when relying on legitimate interest. It also provides that consent must be specifically and unequivocally given, in addition to the current characteristics required under the Data Protection Law.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The proposed legislation will expand the information provided to data subjects and include, among others, the legal basis for processing personal data and the length of time it will be retained. It also includes a new legal basis for processing sensitive data subject to reinforced accountability. Additional changes include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The processing of minors' personal data will be specifically governed under the draft, and the minimum age for granting consent is 16 years.Â </span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Data controllers must report security incidents to the DPA and data subjects within 72 hours of becoming aware of a potential breach.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Consent will only be permitted as a legal basis for the international transfer of personal data when it is exceptional or does not involve a huge number of individuals.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rights of data subjects</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Under the proposed draft, data subjects' right to object to processing personal data will be recognized, in addition to the right to access, rectify, update or suppress their personal data. Currently, this right is only recognized in cases of direct marketing. Data subjects will also have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated or semiautomated processing of personal data when the decision could have discriminatory effects. They will have the right to data portability and the right to request the limitation of data processing. The term to answer data subjects' requests will be ten days for all cases.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When making decisions based solely on automated or semiautomated processing of personal data, data controllers must provide data subjects, upon request, information on the criteria and procedures used in the decision, considering trade and industrial secrets. If data controllers do not provide information based on trade and industrial secrets, the DPA may conduct audits to verify any discriminatory, wrong or biased content of the processing.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Under the proposed draft, data controllers will be allowed to audit data processors to verify compliance with the law. Data processors will be required to inform data controllers and the DPA about security incidents that entail a risk to the administration of personal data. Both data controllers and data processors will be required to implement privacy policies.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Data controllers will also be required to implement privacy by design and privacy by default measures and carry out data protection impact assessments under certain conditions. When the DPIA triggers high risk to data subjects, data controllers will have to file a report before the DPA and will not be allowed to start processing activities until it issues an opinion.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Data controllers and data processors will need to appoint either a data processing officer or a representative in Argentina to register before the National Registry of Persona Data Protection if certain conditions are met.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The draft includes specific rules on data subjects' profiling, and scoring will be introduced.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The DPA will be able to impose fines for a total and maximum amount of USD40 million (at the current exchange rate) or a fine of 2-4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the data controller or data processor.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Finally, data processors are included as possible defendants of habeas data actions under the proposed draft.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If the bill is passed, provisions will enter into force after 180 days of its publication in the Official Gazette, except for Section 79 on administrative sanctions, which will enter into force once it has been published. The DPL will remain in force during the mentioned period, and infringements to the DPL will be sanctioned based on penalties outlined in Section 79.</span></p> ]]></description>

                <title>U.S. privacy legislation in 2023: Something old, something new?</title>
                <guid>https://iapp.org/news/a/u-s-federal-privacy-legislation-in-2023-something-old-something-new</guid>
                <link>https://iapp.org/news/a/u-s-federal-privacy-legislation-in-2023-something-old-something-new</link>
                <description><![CDATA[ <p>While there is little sign that the American Data Privacy and Protection Act will be (re)introduced to Congress any time soon, 2023 has already been marked by both new and previously introduced federal privacy bills vying for lawmakers' attention, scrutiny and support. To further complicate matters, however, federal privacy discussions this year confront several additional entanglements. From the passage of new state privacy laws, to proposed legislation on <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-federal-ai-governance/">artificial intelligence governance</a>, to numerous efforts to reform U.S. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/23/1164724089/in-fight-over-key-surveillance-law-officials-look-to-sway-congressional-skeptics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surveillance law</a>, multiple issues are intersecting with privacy lawmaking efforts at the federal level. Given these recent developments, it is worth examining in more detail the privacy-related legislation proposed within the current Congress to better understand where the federal privacy debate has been recently and where it may be headed.</p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive consumer privacy bills</strong></p>
<p>Within the 118th Congress, at least six bills related to consumer privacy have been introduced through the first half of 2023. Two of these, the Data Care Act of 2023 and the Online Privacy Act of 2023, fall into the omnibus or comprehensive category, establishing a broad range of business obligations and consumer rights. In addition, both bills are modified reintroductions of legislation that appeared in previous years.</p>
<p><strong>Data Care Act</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Care Act of 2023</a>, sponsored by Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, imposes various duties â a duty of care, duty of loyalty and duty of confidentiality â on online service providers. The duty of care is essentially a cybersecurity provision, requiring online service providers to "reasonably secure individual identifying data from unauthorized access" and to inform users of any breaches of this duty. The duty of confidentiality places conditions on a service provider's disclosure or sale of individual identifying data. The duty of loyalty is perhaps the most novel of the three. It prohibits the use of consumer data in ways that "benefit the online service provider to the detriment of an end user."</p>
<p>Within U.S. privacy law, the duty of loyalty has gained attention over the years. In addition to Sen. Schatz's legislation, a duty of loyalty has also been included in a prior iteration of the <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/moving-beyond-notice-and-choice-to-welcome-a-fiduciary-standard/">New York Privacy Act</a>, though the <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version</a> from the current 2023-24 session includes only a duty of confidentiality. And, both the bipartisan <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADPPA</a> and the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3195" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act</a>, introduced in the prior Congress and sponsored by Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., include a duty of loyalty. Yet, while the duty of loyalty concept in privacy law has been articulated perhaps most eloquently by Professors Neil M. Richards and Woodrow Hartzog in "<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3642217" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duty of Loyalty for Privacy Law</a>," each piece of privacy legislation interprets the <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/were-so-close-to-getting-data-loyalty-right/">duty of loyalty</a> in a different way. Indeed, the <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/distilling-the-essence-of-the-american-data-privacy-and-protection-act-discussion-draft/">contents</a> of its provisions differ substantively from bill to bill.</p>
<p>Although the Data Care Act was previously introduced in the 115th, 116th and 117th Congresses, the current version secured more co-sponsors, with 19 in the Senate than any of its prior manifestations.</p>
<p><strong>Online Privacy Act</strong></p>
<p>The other comprehensive consumer privacy bill, Â the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2701" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Online Privacy Act of 2023</a>, sponsored by Reps. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., and Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., Â is also a slightly modified version of previously introduced legislation as it first appeared in <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/4978" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019</a> then again in <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/6027" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021</a>. While it resembles the basic framework of most other comprehensive privacy bills â providing rights to access, correction, deletion, portability, human review of automated decisions, etc., along with requirements for covered entities, including data minimization, prohibitions on disclosure of personal information, notice and consent processes, and privacy policies â it may be the only proposal to establish a new federal entity, the Digital Privacy Agency. The bill vests the agency with certain powers as well as transfers power from the Federal Trade Commission in prescribing rules, issuing guidelines and enforcing federal privacy laws, including the FTC Act, insofar as enforcement pertains to "unfair or deceptive acts or practices relating to privacy, information security, identity theft, data abuses, and related matters."</p>
<p><strong>Narrow consumer privacy bills</strong></p>
<p>The four other bills related to consumer privacy are more limited in scope. They each touch on issues that have defined the federal privacy debate and are worth considering as their provisions may reappear or shape a future compromise privacy bill.</p>
<p><strong>Informing Consumers about Smart Devices Act</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/90" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Informing Consumers about Smart Devices Act</a> is the only bipartisan, bicameral piece of consumer privacy legislation that has been introduced this session. The others are solely sponsored by Democrats. In the Senate, the act is cosponsored by Chair and Ranking Member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Sen. Cantwell, while in the House of Representatives it is sponsored by Rep. John Curtis, R-Utah. Narrow in scope, the bill requires smart device makers to disclose that a camera or microphone is included in a device to consumers prior to purchase. It does not apply, however, to mobile phones, laptops or other devices that a reasonable consumer would expect to have a camera or microphone.</p>
<p>Yet, like the others, this is not a new piece of legislation. It was previously introduced in both the 117th and 116th Congressesâagain, in the Senate by Cruz and in the House by Curtis.</p>
<p><strong>The UPHOLD Privacy Act</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/631" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upholding Protections for Health and Online Location Data Privacy Act</a>, sponsored by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., establishes protections for personally identifiable health and location data. This is one of <a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2023/3/klobuchar-warren-hirono-introduce-legislation-to-expand-personal-health-data-privacy-protections" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several bills</a> proposed in the wake of the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade, aimed at preventing the <a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2023/3/klobuchar-warren-hirono-introduce-legislation-to-expand-personal-health-data-privacy-protections" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collection and sale</a> of health and location data "that could be used to identify women seeking reproductive health care services." These bills align with President Joe Biden's July 2022 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/07/08/executive-order-on-protecting-access-to-reproductive-healthcare-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">executive order</a> intended to protect the privacy of abortion-related data, which also prompted the Department of Health and Human Services and the FTC to "use their <a class="mktNoTok" href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10786" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statutory authorities</a> to protect this data."</p>
<p>In terms of its main provisions, the UPHOLD Privacy Act:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prohibits the use of health data in commercial advertising.</li>
<li>Establishes minimization requirements for the collection, retention, use, disclosure and employee access to data.</li>
<li>Prohibits sale of location data to and from data brokers.</li>
<li>Establishes rights of access and deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exceptions to the bill include "publication of newsworthy information of legitimate public concern," issuance of public health campaigns and compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Violations would be enforced jointly by the FTC, under its Section 5 authority, and through an individual private right of action. It would preserve, rather than preempt, state laws that provide greater protection.</p>
<p><strong>The DELETE Act</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://trahan.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2934" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Elimination and Limiting Extensive Tracking and Exchange Act</a> is another previously introduced billÂ  that reappeared in the 118th Congress. First proposed in both the House and the Senate last year, the bipartisan, bicameral DELETE Act would direct the FTC to establish a centralized system allowing individuals to request deletion of their personal information from data brokers. Data brokers, defined in the bill as entities that knowingly collect or obtain the personal information of individuals with whom the entity does not have a "direct relationship," would have to register annually with the FTC.</p>
<p>A similar bill, SB 362, the <a href="https://sd13.senate.ca.gov/news/press-release/may-31-2023/senator-beckers-delete-act-advances-senate-floor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delete Act</a>, was also recently approved by the California Senate. Mirroring the federal bill, SB 362 would require data brokers to register with the California Privacy Protection Agency and provide a centralized system for Californians to freely request any personal information held by data brokers to be deleted. The so-called "<a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/data-broker-registries-bills-adppa-and-delete-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data brokerage ecosystem</a>" that would be regulated by these bills was also the subject of the "<a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/events/oversight-and-investigations-subcommittee-hearing-who-is-buying-and-selling-your-data-shining-a-light-on-data-brokers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Who is Selling Your Data: A Critical Examination of the Role of Data Brokers in the Digital Economy</a>" hearing by the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee in April. In her <a class="mktNoTok" href="https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/Moy_Testimony_4_19_23_Updated_f93f89d5b9.pdf?updated_at=2023-04-19T16:30:06.718Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testimony</a> urging Congress to act, Georgetown University Law Center Professor Laura Moy argued "people are not okay with the status quo" and they "overwhelmingly express dissatisfaction regarding this lack of control" of the information data brokers hold about them. She also explained how the "booming" data broker industry "does real harm to real people in a multitude of ways"â such as by fueling scammers, enabling predatory marketing, facilitating stalking and harassment, helping law enforcement <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-police-government-surveillance-d395409ef5a8c6c3f6cdab5b1d0e27efhttps:/apnews.com/article/technology-police-government-surveillance-d395409ef5a8c6c3f6cdab5b1d0e27ef" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agencies</a> circumvent constitutional <a href="https://columbialawreview.org/content/laundering-data-how-the-governments-purchase-of-commercial-location-data-violates-carpenter-and-evades-the-fourth-amendment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protections</a>, disseminating inaccurate information, increasing data breach vulnerabilities, and putting minors at risk.</p>
<p><u>Stop Spying Bosses Act</u></p>
<p>Lastly, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stop Spying Bosses Act</a>, as its name implies, focuses on providing workplace privacy for individuals. This bill would require any employer who engages in surveillance of, or data collection about, its employees or applicants to disclose:</p>
<ul>
<li>What data is collected.</li>
<li>How it is used.</li>
<li>How such surveillance affects workers' performance assessments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain types of employee workplace surveillance are also prohibited by the bill, including monitoring activities related to labor organizations, collecting health information unrelated to job duties, monitoring off-duty workers and using of automated decision-making, including machine learning or AI techniques, to predict the behavior of workers unrelated to their jobs. The bill would also establish a new Privacy and Technology Division within the Department of Labor to enforce the law, in conjunction with state attorneys general and individuals via a private right of action.</p>
<p><strong>What next?</strong></p>
<p>While other pieces of U.S. federal privacy legislation have been introduced in the 118th Congress, the above represent only the consumer-centric privacy bills. Although many such bills will be introduced this session, the ones proposed so far have unique provisions, from the Data Care Act establishing a "duty of care" to The Online Privacy Act overhauling the FTCâs privacy enforcement authority to the DELETE Act bringing regulation to an industry that has mostly been operating without oversight.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, the increasing number of comprehensive state privacy laws may be both a cause and an effect of the absence of federal legislation. As Joe Duball explains in his <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/state-privacy-dispatch-the-floodgates-are-open/">state privacy dispatch</a>, one of the biggest reasons more state legislators are working on privacy legislation is lack of such movement in Congress. The effect of the continued passage of comprehensive state privacy laws on the prospects for a federal comprehensive privacy law remains a key question.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/a-view-from-dc-a-red-wave-of-state-privacy-wars/">partisan dynamics</a> around state-level privacy lawmaking, highlighted by Cobun Zweifel-Keegan, as well as the interplay between the federal and state levels are fascinating. Yet the scenario in which companies must comply with 50 different U.S. privacy standards does not seem to be materializing. This is, at least in part, due to the way state lawmakers have communicated with their counterparts in other states to ensure some consistency across the state privacy laws and avoid the emergence of a "<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/events/thestateofthestates-u-s-state-l7071586132697735168/theater/">patchwork</a>" of legislation.</p>
<p>Discussions around federal privacy continue to be shaped by numerous competing priorities and agendas. Ongoing legislative and executive focus on issues such as <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1418" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">children's privacy</a> and reproductive health privacy, for example, may tip the scales in favor of a narrower privacy bill over a comprehensive or omnibus one passing at the federal level. Were any one of these bills â whether comprehensive or narrow â to become law, it would have a significant impact on U.S. privacy rights in the and the future trajectory of such right.</p> ]]></description>

                <description><![CDATA[ <p><span data-contrast="auto">Feb. 17 marked the deadline for California legislators to introduce bills for the current legislative session. Among more than 2700 bills introduced by state senators and assembly members, 10Â proposed amendments to the California Consumer Privacy Act and the </span><a href="https://casetext.com/statute/california-codes/california-civil-code/division-3-obligations/part-4-obligations-arising-from-particular-transactions/title-18-personal-data/chapter-1-information-practices-act-of-1977" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Information Practices Act of 1977</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, which imposes purpose limitations, consent requirements and other privacy protections over personal data held by the government. Other bills address topics like updating the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, platform liability and student data privacy. While a significant majority of data privacy-related bills were introduced by elected representatives from the Democratic Party, Assemblymen Joe Patterson, Jim Patterson and Tri Ta offered a few bills from across the aisle.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Below is a summary of notable bill proposals from the most recent California legislative session. Although historically many of these bills die in committee and never pass, they provide insight into how elected California officials think about privacy issues and trends privacy professionals may see in other states. The </span><a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/ccpa-cpra-related-legislation-tracker/"><span data-contrast="none">CCPA-/CPRA-Related Legislation Tracker</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> in the IAPP Resource Center provides a comprehensive look at these bills and others not detailed below.</span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">California looks to fortify reproductive health data privacy</span></b></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">State houses continue to respond to the Supreme Courtâs overturning of Roe v. Wade, and California is no exception. </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB254" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Assembly Bill 254</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> proposes an amendment to the CMIA that would broaden the definition of medical information to include data from reproductive or sexual health mobile apps and websites, and bring businesses that collect and manage this data into the scope of the act. Relatedly, businesses that process personal information related to services for contraception, pregnancy care and abortions, including consumer web searches for such services, would be brought within scope of the CCPA under proposed </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">AB 1194</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">These California bills reflect similar partisan efforts in other states to protect womenâs reproductive health data. A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB852" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Virginia bill</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> that shields menstrual data stored in mobile apps from search warrants easily passed out of the Democrat-led Senate but was later stopped in a GOP-led House </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/02/14/youngkin-menstrual-data-abortion-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="auto">subcommittee vote</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Comparatively, California passed a similar </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/29/california-law-protects-digital-info-from-use-in-abortion-investigations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">bill</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">Â prohibiting companies from complying with data requests in out-of-state warrants for procedures deemed legal in California. The Washington state </span><a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1155&amp;Year=2023&amp;Initiative=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="auto">My Health, My Data Act</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> appears to have a better chance at success than Virginiaâs bill, with its proposed protections of consumer health data and special focus on reproductive or sexual health data.</span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Operational changes would support the attorney general and data brokers</span></b></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Although the majority of substantive updates and clarifications to the CCPA this year will come via Californiaâs regulatory rulemaking process, a few bills still aim to codify small operational updates to the comprehensive privacy bill. </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1546" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">AB 1546</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> would clarify that the attorney general may commence an enforcement action under the CCPA up to five years after cause of action accrued. This is a significant departure from the existing general law, which imposes a one-year statute of limitations for statutory enforcement actions. Democratic legislators also signaled their commitment to consumer protection with the introduction of </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">AB 947</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, which originally would have added consumer rights to the list of qualifications considered for the California Privacy Protection Agencyâs governing five-member board. On March 6, the Committee on Privacy and Consumer Protection amended the bill to instead expand the definition of sensitive personal information to include a consumerâs citizenship or immigration status.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Data brokers and other privacy pros operating in California should also take note of </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB362" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">AB 362</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, which would extend the annual deadline for data brokers to register with the attorney general from Jan. 31 to Feb. 15.</span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Platform liability and student privacy â¦ sometimes in the same bill</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">Â </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The wave of introduced legislation also addressed some platform liability and student privacy issues through several proposed bills. The hotly contested </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB287" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">SB 287</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> would impose penalties on social media platforms using algorithms and other designs they know could promote the sale of fentanyl, illegal guns or other self-harming behaviors to minors. Advocates from both industry and civil protections groups are already </span><a href="https://www.govtech.com/policy/the-battle-over-california-social-media-liability-bill-mounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">weighing in</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> on the bill. The âknowing actionsâ of social media platforms were also addressed in </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1394" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">AB 1394</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, which targets the use of platforms for commercial sexual exploitation and would require platforms to comply with requests from minor victims to remove content relating to their exploitation.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The proposed </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB845" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">Let Parents Choose Protection Act</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> would require social media platforms to enable third-party software providers to manage a âchildâs online interactions, content, and account settings,â if given permission by a parent, guardian or user of at least 13 years old. Although the act is less stringent than Utahâs recently enacted </span><a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/a-view-from-dc-in-utah-parent-over-shoulder-will-be-the-new-normal/"><span data-contrast="none">Social Media Regulation Act</span></a> <span data-contrast="none">â</span><span data-contrast="auto"> which requires platforms to allow parents or guardians access to minorsâ account information, including messages, and prohibit all advertising to underage users </span><span data-contrast="none">â</span><span data-contrast="auto">Â the California bill flows in the same recent </span><a href="https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/client-alerts/20230227-child-privacy-law-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">wave</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> of youth privacy regulation. </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">AB 801</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, another youth privacy bill introduced this session, would mandate operators like online service providers to honor deletion requests for studentsâ covered information.</span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">A potpourri of privacy for other sectors</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">Â </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are a few bills focused on context and use cases that may be important for privacy pros. Representatives took aim at the public sector through </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1034" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">AB 1034</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB302" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">AB 302</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. The former states the legislatureâs intent to regulate the use of biometric surveillance by law enforcement. The latter requires the Department of Technology to inventory its high-risk, automated decision-making systems and submit a report to the legislature by Jan. 1, 2025. Finally, the EUâs </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/eu-car-data-tussle-insurers-others-brace-delays-disappointment-2023-02-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">calls</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> for greater regulation of connected car data practices were reflected in </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB296" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">SB 296</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, a bill introduced in the California Senate that would impose restrictions on the retention, use and sale of images and video recordings captured by in-vehicle cameras.</span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Looking ahead</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">Â </span></h4>

                <title>What does Japan&#039;s External Data Transmission Rule mean?</title>

                <link>https://iapp.org/news/a/japan-to-enact-external-data-transmission-rule-of-amended-telecommunications-business-act</link>
                <description><![CDATA[ <p>On June 16, Japan will enact the amended Telecommunications Business Act, including the External Data Transmission Rule. This new rule, regarding the use of user information, shares some fundamental ideas with the cookie consent requirements of the EU ePrivacy Directive and applies to various online services provided through web browsers and apps. Businesses offering online services should confirm whether the rule applies to their services, and consider whether to amend existing policies or even establish new ones.</p>
<h4><strong>Data protection scope of the APPI</strong></h4>
<p>In Japan, the general privacy law is set out in the Act on the Protection of Personal Information, which provides rules for the handling of personal information and data. Under the APPI, "personal information" is defined as information about an individual that can be used or combined with other data to identify the specific individual. Personal data means personal information constituting part of a personal information database. Personal information and personal data are subject to various rules within the APPI, including the requirement of notification at the time of collection and the obligation to obtain consent of the data subject when personal data is provided to a third party.</p>
<p>It should be noted if certain information cannot be used to identify a specific individual, it does not fall into either personal information or personal data, even if such information relates to a natural person. However, the amended APPI, which came into effect April 2022, imposes a new obligation on data providers when they provide third parties with "personally referable information." Not falling under personal information, this data type includes a person's website browsing history collected through cookies and other online identifiers, as well as information indicating their product purchase history, service usage history and interests. Personally referable information also concerns, for the purpose of confirming a data subject's consent, whether the recipient will receive the information as personal data. That is to say, the recipient is able to identify the specific individual by combining the personally referable information with other information they have, thereby making the combined information personal data. In previous articles, we provided an <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/practical-notes-for-the-amended-appi-how-to-amend-privacy-notices/">overview</a> of the new regulation and <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/practical-notes-for-japans-important-updates-of-the-appi-guidelines-and-qas/">practical guidance</a> on it by the guidelines.</p>
<h4><strong>Introduction of the External Data Transmission Rule</strong></h4>
<p>To ensure comprehensive transparency about the use of data concerning users of telecom services, the External Data Transmission Rule requires covered telecom businesses directing the transmission of user information (e.g., identifiers such as IDs recorded in cookies, advertising IDs, users' behavioral information such as webpage history, usernames, contact information of friends, etc.) recorded in the user's device to anyone other than the user themselves to do one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Notify users of this transmission.</li>
<li>Publicly announce this transmission.</li>
<li>Obtain the consent of users for this transmission.</li>
<li>Enable users to opt out of this transmission and publicly announce the existence of this option.</li>
</ol>
<p>This applies when the business is offering telecom services specified in the applicable Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications ordinance.</p>
<p>This rule covers broader situations on the use of user information than the APPI does, and is also conceptually similar to the cookie consent requirements of the EU ePrivacy Directive. However, in a sense, this rule is milder than the APPI and the ePrivacy Directive, because it does not require covered businesses to obtain the user consent. Instead, it merely requires a notice or public announcement that the transmission will suffice.</p>
<h4><strong>What is covered by the External Data Transmission Rule?</strong></h4>
<p>The scope of the rule is, in fact, very broad. Pursuant to the applicable MIC ordinance and the draft commentary to the rule released by the MIC in December 2022, the specific telecom services subject to the rule are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Telecom services intermediating communications between other persons, e.g., email services, direct messaging services and closed online meeting services.</li>
<li>Telecom services that
<ol>
<li>Record and store information received from users in servers and send such information at the request of unspecified users, e.g., social media services, online bulletin board services, video sharing services, online shopping malls, sharing services and matching services.</li>
<li>Â Simultaneously send information received from users at the request of unspecified users, e.g., live streaming services, online gaming services.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Online searching services.</li>
<li>Services offering various types of information, including news, weather forecasts, videos, maps, transfer guides and job searches.</li>
</ol>
<p>This rule can also apply to telecommunication services not required to be registered with the MIC under the TBA, and the above fourth category in particular covers a wide range of online services. However, if a business simply posts information about itself on its website, or sells its own products on its retail website, the business is then providing telecom services for its own purposes and is therefore not subject to the rule.</p>
<p><strong>What must be done when the External Data Transmission Rule applies?</strong></p>
<p>When the External Data Transmission Rule applies and businesses notify or publicly announce the required information, they are obligated to provide certain information in a prescribed manner. Specifically, business must inform users of:</p>
<ol>
<li>The items of user information to be transmitted.</li>
<li>Which entity operates the destination (external) server.</li>
<li>The purpose for which the user information is to be transmitted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Businesses must provide this information in the following prescribed manner:</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing the information in Japanese, avoiding the use of technical terms and using plain language.</li>
<li>Displaying text in an appropriate size without the need for additional user manipulation.</li>
<li>Ensuring users can easily check this information in other respects, such as adopting easy-to-read font colors in consideration of websites or app backgrounds, and layering the webpage so users can see the entirety of the notification without scrolling.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the above, when businesses notify users of the information, the businesses must display either the information or the location of the page containing such information, like a URL, on the user's telecom device just in time, such as in a pop-up. If only some parts of the information are displayed in the notification, it is necessary to ensure users can easily reach the rest of the information. Alternatively, businesses must ensure users can recognize the information as easily as or more easily than the above.</p>
<p>Also, when businesses publicly announce the information, the businesses must:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the case of a website, display the information on a webpage the users access or a webpage easily locatable by users from such webpage.</li>
<li>In the case of mobile apps, display the information on the first page of the app, or on a page easily locatable by users from the first page.</li>
<li>Ensure users can recognize the information as easily as or more easily than in the above points.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Exemptions to the obligations of the External Data Transmission Rule</h4>
<p>There are some exceptional cases where covered telecom businesses are not required to implement either of the above-mentioned measures.</p>
<p>One exception is for information that must be transmitted to use the telecom service, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Information necessary for providing the telecom service, such as information necessary to properly display codes, sounds or images on the screen of users' telecom device, including operating systems, display settings, language settings and web browsers. In the draft commentary the MIC says information sent to the provider of the telecom service that the user actually and intentionally uses (as opposed to information transmitted automatically or without the userâs direct intention) falls within this exemption. This is fairly different from the EU ePrivacy Directive idea concerning a "strictly necessary" exemption, decided mainly on the purpose of the cookies.</li>
<li>Information necessary for redisplaying information on the user's screen that the user previously input when using the telecommunication service. This includes information necessary for redisplaying goods in a shopping basket, when a user accessed an online shopping mall, put such goods in the their basket and later returned to the online shopping mall.</li>
<li>Information necessary for redisplaying information concerning the user's authorization that they entered when using the telecom service.</li>
<li>Information necessary for detecting abusive or improper acts against the telecom service, or for mitigating the damage of such unfair acts. In the draft commentary to the rule, the MIC says this exemption only applies to information transmission necessary for security measurements for the telecom services which the user uses.</li>
<li>Information for appropriate operation of the telecom service, such as information necessary for load reduction or load balancing of the telecom facilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another exception is for identification codes sent to the user by the telecom service provider that are sent back, such as first-party cookie identifiers.</p>
<h4>What will happen next?</h4>
<p>The MIC is now finalizing the draft commentary to the rule. It is expected to solicit public comments in March and April to finalize the rule and publicly announce it before the rule comes into force June 16.</p> ]]></description>
